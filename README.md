## Key Skills

- **Trading Systems:** order lifecycle, dual-leg hedging, execution safety, latency-aware design, retries, idempotency  
- **Strategies:** delta-neutral funding, basis, cross-exchange arbitrage, on-chain routing and slippage control  
- **Python:** Python 3.10+ (asyncio, WebSocket, REST), data pipelines, CLI tools, robust logging and observability  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, on-chain accounting, vault logic, route validation, token standards (ERC-20), production deployment and testing  
- **DeFi:** AMMs (Uniswap V3, Camelot), lending/derivatives primitives, price impact modeling, gas/fee optimization, on-chain monitoring  
- **Data and Infra:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, Linux, config management (Pydantic), CI/CD, alerting (Telegram)  
- **Risk Controls:** slippage and timeout guards, position tracking, stop-loss/take-profit automation, circuit breakers and safety fallbacks
